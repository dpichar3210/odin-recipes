        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Place chicken into a large pot and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, 
                and simmer until chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Remove from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Shred chicken with two forks</li>
            <li>
                Combine sour cream, condensed soup, and chili powder in a saucepan.
                Bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, then turn off the heat and cover to keep warm.
            </li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion;
                cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add shredded chicken, water,
                1/2 of the green onions, green chiles, and taco seasoning; simmer for 10 minutes.
                Stir in lime juice, onion powder, and garlic powder; simmer for 10 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F (175 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup soup mixture into the skillet with the chicken. Spread remaining soup mixture over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Fill each tortilla with 1/5 of the chicken mixture and about 5 tablespoons Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>
                Roll tortillas around filling and place enchiladas, seam-side down, into the baking dish.
                Pour enchilada sauce over top and sprinkle with remaining Cheddar, remaining green onions, and olives.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until filling is heated through and cheese is melted and bubbling, about 25 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
